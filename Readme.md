# Top 5 Movies

The project consists of a simple mobile app for movie fans to showcase ordered lists of their favourite movies. Users should be able to create multiple “Top 5” lists that will be displayed on their profile.

For backend service simplicity feel free to use Firebase (or similar).

**Requirements:**
- Simple sign-up/login/logout auth system (basic username+password will do)
- Profile TOP5 lists CRUD functionality
- Ability to view another user's TOP5 Profile by providing their username
- Decisions can be made for caching and persistence needs
